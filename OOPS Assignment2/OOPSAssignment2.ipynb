    "### **Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features to the user. By using abstraction, we focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps in reducing complexity, improving code readability, and enhancing reusability and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Features of Abstraction**\n",
    "- Hides implementation details: Only the necessary details are exposed, while the internal workings are hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplifies code usage: The user interacts with the high-level interface without worrying about low-level complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented using: Abstract Classes (using abstract methods in Python with the abc module).\n",
    "Interfaces (in languages like Java)."
